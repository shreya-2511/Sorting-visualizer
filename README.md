📌 Project Objective

Many learners struggle to grasp sorting algorithms due to the lack of visualization. This project aims to make algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Quick Sort** more intuitive by animating their behavior in real time.
* DOM manipulation using JavaScript
* Implementing animations
* Responsive UI development using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap

🧠 Algorithms Implemented
* 🫧 Bubble Sort
* 🔍 Selection Sort
* 🧩 Insertion Sort
* ⚡ Quick Sort

🖥️ Tech Stack
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* UI Library: Bootstrap for styling and layout

🎯 Features
* Visual representation of array elements as vertical bars
* Real-time animations showing element comparisons and swaps
* Adjustable sorting speed and array size
* "Generate New Array" button to shuffle values
* Interactive UI with sorting controls
* Highlighting elements being compared and sorted

🧭 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

3. Use the UI controls to:
   * Generate a new array
   * Choose a sorting algorithm
   * Adjust array size and speed
   * Visualize the sorting process

Inspired by many online sorting visualizers and built as a learning project to strengthen understanding of core JavaScript concepts and sorting algorithms.
